*Notes: One of my favorite restaurants and one of the 3-5 restaraunts I eat at on a regular basis. Subway has plenty of healthy
options, such as their 9-grain wheat bread, Swiss cheese, multitude of vegetables, etc.. Their sandwiches are also packed with 
protein and calories, which is good fuel for your body. Being the biggest fast food chain in the world, they are relatively 
easy to find.*
