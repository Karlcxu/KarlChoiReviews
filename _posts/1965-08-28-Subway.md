*Notes: One of my favorite restaurants and one of the 3-5 restaraunts I eat at on a regular basis. Contrary to popular belief,
not everything at Subway is healthy, but they do have quite a few healthy items such as their 9-grain wheat, Tuna, Swiss 
cheese, etc. Their sandwiches are also packed with protein and calories, which is good fuel for your body. Being the biggest 
fast food chain in the world, they are relatively easy to find.*
