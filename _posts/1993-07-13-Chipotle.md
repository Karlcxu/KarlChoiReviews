*Notes: One of my favorite restaraunts and one of the 3-5 restaurants I eat at on a regular basis. If you haven't eaten here, I recommend
doing so as soon as possible! However, worldwide, Chipotle does not have many locations. Also, be aware of serving sizes. Some Chipotle 
employees skimp out on meat or rice, so always try to get extra if possible (and if you want more, that is).*
