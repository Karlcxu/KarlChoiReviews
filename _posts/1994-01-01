Nutrition: 3/5

Price: 3.5/5

Service: 4/5

Taste: 5/5

### Overall: 3.5/5 (Good)

*Notes: Wingstop has a good amount of restaurants, but not nearly as much as popular fast food chains (e.g. Mcdonalds, Burger King,
 etc.). Their wings, sauces, and fries taste very good and have a large amount of protein but can be high in sodium.*
