*Notes: Great graphics and animations! There are also extensive guides you can find online, due to the age of this game. However, 
that's mostly it for the pros. Although the combat system is fun and fresh at the beginning, it quickly gets boring after grinding
out a few missions - which you are forced to do in order to progress in the game. The shop favors swords and only has one viable 
magic weapon. In addition, the NPC's take too long to think, and the movement animations seem slower the longer you play. Every 
character has far too much health, which makes missions and clan wars last forever; potion stalling by the NPC's just makes it 
worse. If you don't mind the grind - or enjoy it even, this game is for you.*
