*Notes: Great graphics and animations! There are also extensive guides you can find online, due to the age of this game. However, 
that's mostly it for the pros. Although the combat system is fun and fresh at the beginning, it quickly gets boring after grinding 
out a few missions - which you must do in order to progress in the game. In addition, the NPC's take too long to think, and the 
movement animations seem slower the longer you play. Every character has far too much health, which makes missions and clan wars 
last forever; potion stalling by the NPC's just makes it worse. If you don't mind the grind - or enjoy it even, this game is for 
you.*
