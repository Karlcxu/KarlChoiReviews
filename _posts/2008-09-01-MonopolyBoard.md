title: Monopoly [Board]

Gameplay: 3.5/5

Intensity: 2/5

Replayability: 4/5

Structure: 1/5

### Overall: 2.5/5 (Mediocre)

*Notes: Everyone knows it, so it isn't hard to convince people to play. However, the game has so many accessories that it can get
real messy, and the rules are so poorly designed that barely any uses them. House rules are very popular with this game - which I
suggest.*
