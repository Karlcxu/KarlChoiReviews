title: Just Water

Bottle Design: 3/5

Price: 4/5

Taste: 4/5

### Overall: 3/5 (Mediocre)

*Notes: Tastes pure, but the taste of Just is acquired. Although I now like the taste, it was pretty weird at first - compared to other
bottled water brands. In bulk, Just Water is also extremely expensive compared to brands like Kirkland; Just Water is about a dollar more
per bottle. In addition, one thing that could be a problem about the bottle design is that it is opaque, but the bottle material is soft 
and nice to hold.*
