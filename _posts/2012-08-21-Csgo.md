*Notes: A game that tests aim, reflex, speed, and positioning. Arguably one of the best shooter games out there, and is best
played with friends. One flaw is that some guns are significantly bettter than others, like the AK and AWP. Another flaw is the poor
contrast of players and the environment, which makes it hard for some players to see the opponents - as they blend in with the map.*
