Availability: 0.5/5

Nutrition: 3.5/5

Price: 4/5

Service: 2.5/5

Taste: 4/5

### Overall: 3/5 (Mediocre)

*Notes: The service itself was great, but beware: the food may cause stomach problems [this is what lowers the service subscore]. 
Taste and quality of meat was mediocre for Korean BBQ, and the price was a little high - like most Korean BBQs.*
