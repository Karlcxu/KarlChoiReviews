Aesthetics: 4/5

Durability: 4/5

Ease of Use: 4/5

Ergonomics: 4/5

Functionality: 4.5/5

Price: 3.5/5

### Overall: 4/5 (Good)

Notes: *Screen emits an excessive amount of light and has slighty sticky buttons [compared to the TI-36X Pro]. It also gets dirty 
extremely easily. Charging can be a hassle as well. Unless you plan to graph, this calculator is not worth using or buying.*
