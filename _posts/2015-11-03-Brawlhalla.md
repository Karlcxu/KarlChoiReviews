### Overall: 2/5 (Bad)

*Notes: An akward fighting game in both gameplay and graphics that requires a ton of time investement. The game has bad flow, ugly character models, and mediocre music. Also, spam is not punishable enough. Stay away from this game if you are not planning to spend tens of hours on it. Brawlhalla also has a broken ranking system that makes it hard for players to progress in rank. If you are looking for a fighting game, you are better off playing Super Smash Bros.*
