*Notes: An akward fighting game in both gameplay and graphics that requires a ton of time investement. Stay away from this game if you 
are not planning to spend tens of hours on a game. Brawlhalla also has a broken ranking system that makes it hard for players to progress in rank. If you are looking for a fighting game, you are better off playing Super Smash Bros.*
