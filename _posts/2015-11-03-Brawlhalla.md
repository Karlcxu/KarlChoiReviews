### Overall: 2/5 (Bad)

*Notes: An akward fighting game in both gameplay and graphics that requires a ton of time investement. The game has bad flow, ugly character models, and mediocre music. Also, spam is not punishable enough. Stay away from this game if you are not planning to 
spend hundreds of hours on it. Furthermore, Brawlhalla has a broken ranking system that makes it hard for players to progress in 
rank. If you are looking for a fighting game, you are better off playing Super Smash Bros.*
