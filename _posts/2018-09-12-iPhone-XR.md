Aesthetics: 4/5

Durability: 4.5/5

Ease of Use: 5/5

Ergonomics: 3/5

Functionality: 5/5

Price: 4/5

### Overall: 4/5 (Good)

Notes: *This phone is very good besides the fact that it is a little awkward when held with one hand (due to its width) and its 
~$750 price tag (at the time of writing). The OS itself is simple and easy to undestand.*
