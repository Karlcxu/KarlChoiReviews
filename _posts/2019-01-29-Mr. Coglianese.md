---

Grading: 1/5

Personality: 1.5/5

Teaching ability: 1/5

### Overall: 1/5 (Horrible)

*Notes: Coglianese does not teach himself, but rather assigns online assignments for his students to tediously work on. Despite this fact,
he still grades harshly and gives difficult tests. In addition, he rarely talks to his students.*
