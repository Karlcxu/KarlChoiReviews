Grading: N/A

Personality: 2/5

Responsibility: 1/5

Teaching ability: 0/5

### Overall: 1/5 (Horrible)

*Notes: Fullerton's Troy High School Librarian is lazy. She frequently closes the library 5-20 minutes early and sometimes
even closes it entirely some days, despite the fact that she literally just sits in her chair doing little to nothing.
In addition, a good librarian has a proper understanding of research tips and documentation, but this librarian's
annoyed tone leads no one to ask her for help - and the fact she does know how to conduct good research is questionable. 
"No backpacks on the table."*
