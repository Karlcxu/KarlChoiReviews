title: 900's Boys' Restroom [Troy High School, Fullerton]
---

Accessibility: 2/5

Cleanliness: 2/5

Comfortability: 3/5

Size: 4/5

Smelliness: 2/5 

### Overall: 3/5 (Mediocre)

*Notes: This is the biggest restroom at Troy, but there is sometimes a lot of traffic after school due to ROTC; expect very long wait times after school. I suggest going after 3:20pm if you plan to go after school. Also, due to its popularity, on average, it is one of the dirtier and smellier restrooms on campus.*
