title: Boys' Gate Restroom [Troy High School, Fullerton]
---

Accessibility: 1/5

Cleanliness: 3/5

Comfortability: 3/5

Size: 1/5

Smelliness: 1/5 

### Overall: 2.5/5 (Mediocre)

*Notes: Although this restroom is very good in quality, it is small and often closed. I suggest going to this restroom before
school ends, since that's when it's usually closed for sure. In addition, on average, it is the farthest restroom from where you 
are - which makes it even more inconvenient.*
