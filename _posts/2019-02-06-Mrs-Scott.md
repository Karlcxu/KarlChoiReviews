Grading: 5/5

Personality: 3/5

Teaching ability: 4/5

### Overall: 4/5 (Good)

*Notes: Enthusiastic about teaching, but sometimes is dramatic/goes off tangent and discusses social issues. Tries very hard to 
make her students learn. Doesn't give too much homework and grades leniently. Wants students to succeed.*
