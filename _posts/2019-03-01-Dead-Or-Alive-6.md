Balance: 2/5

Community: 2/5

Gameplay: 4/5

Replayability: 2.5/5

Soundtrack: 3/5

Story: 3/5

Structure: 5/5

Visuals: 5/5

### Overall: 3.5/5 (Good)

*Notes: Very difficult. Learning just the basics of the game can easily take hours. Also, pretty unbalanced - many characters are
not on the same level. If you are down to invest time into a fighting game, this game may be for you. If not, stick to something 
easier like Super Smash Bros.*
