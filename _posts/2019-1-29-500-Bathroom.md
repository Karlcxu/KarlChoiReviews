---

Accessibility: 5/5

Size: 3/5

Cleanliness: 3/5

Smelliness: 1/5 

Comfortability: 3/5

### Overall: 4/5 (Good)

*Notes: Since it's at the middle of the school, on average, it's the easiest to reach. The 500's boys' bathroom has no heavy smell and has 3 toilets, which helps reduces wait times.*
