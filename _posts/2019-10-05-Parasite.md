### Overall: 4/5 (Good)

*Notes: Great cinematography, build-up, suspense, and shock value. Amazing until the ending. Ending does not seem well thought out like the rest of the film, and feels rushed. 
Questionable events happen during the final major scene of the movie. At the end of the movie, the message(s) the movie was trying to convey is cloudy and I don't think I agree 
with it.*
