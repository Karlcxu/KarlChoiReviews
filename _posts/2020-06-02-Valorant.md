*Notes: A solid shooter game which is differentiated by its use of abilities and unique characters. This, however, presents a new problem:
balancing each individual unique character - which is clearly not done perfectly as some characters are noticeably better than others.
Despite this flaw, what puts it above other shooters are its visuals. Unlike games like CS:GO, Valorant draws an outline around each 
enemy - allowing players to see them very clearly. In contrast, CS:GO does not implement any outlines for enemies - causing enemies
to blend in with the background.*
