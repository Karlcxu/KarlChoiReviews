title: Texas Instruments TI-89 Titanium
---

Aesthetics: 3/5

Durability: 4.5/5

Ease of Use: 2.5/5

Ergonomics: 2.5/5

Functionality: 5/5

Price: 3.5/5

### Overall: 3.5/5 (Good)

Notes: *Decent screen and good battery life. Top tier in terms on computing and functional capabilities, but does have several 
downsides. Sticky keys (compared to the TI-36X Pro) and too thick. So many functions that it takes more time to find a function 
than it does to solve the problem. Not worth buying or using unless for high level mathematics.*
