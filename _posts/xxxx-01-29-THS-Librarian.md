Grading: N/A

Personality: 2/5

Responsibility: 1/5

Teaching ability: 0/5

### Overall: 1/5 (Horrible)

*Notes: Fullerton's Troy High School Librarian is lazy. She frequently closes the library 5-15 minutes early and sometimes
even closes it entirely some days, despite the fact that she literally just sits in her chair doing little to nothing. Occasionally, she even plays music out loud for all to hear. Besides the music, the library is usually always set to a temperature of 68-70 degrees, meaning freezing is a sacrifice you must pay to stay in there. In addition, a good librarian (or "librarian technician") has a proper understanding of research tips and documentation, but this librarian's annoyed tone leads no one to ask her for help - and her knowledge of how to conduct good research is questionable. "No backpacks on the table."*
