Grading: 5/5

Personality: 2/5

Teaching ability: 4/5

### Overall: 3.5/5 (Good)

*Notes: Enthusiastic about teaching, but sometimes is dramatic/goes off tangent and discusses social issues. Tries very hard to 
make her students learn. Doesn't give too much homework and grades leniently. Wants students to succeed. Puts blame on students sometimes.*
